# Introduction to Semios Protocol

`ERC721 ←Block→ ERC20`

Semios Protocol is a LEGO-inspired Tokenomics toolkit, crafted for crypto communities to foster bottom-up, emergent economic experiences.

Flexible Tokenomics LEGO 
  Higher costs, risks, and longer cycles impact tokenomics, poses a significant barrier to crypto innovation.
  Semios Protocol offers a zero-code, modular, and composable tokenomics toolkit for crypto startups to effectively validate diverse economic models with low risk.
  
721 ← Block → 20 Metadata Structure
  By introducing the 721 ← Block → 20 metadata structure, the Semios Protocol integrates block structures, asynchronous clocks, and local consensus mechanisms. 
  This approach adeptly accommodates the community emergence event oracle into plenty diverse on-chain assets, creating a rich spectrum of trading scenarios, and achieving crypto community ecosystem governance through trading rather than voting.

Launchpad Reflight
  Semios Protocol offers early-stage crypto startups a non-custodial financing model, empowering community seed users to secure funding without custodial risk. 
  It essentially transforms users into distributed makers in the primary market, allowing them to share in early dividends and shape consensus through a fair launch.
